1. User Management:
	a. Interface (IUserService): Will contain methods related to user operations like registration, login, profile management, etc.
	b. Abstract Class (BaseUser): A base class for common user properties, and Driver and Rider classes inherit from it.
	c. Generics: A generic repository pattern for CRUD operations, reusable for different user entities.
	d. Custom Attributes: Implement validation attributes on user models for property validation.
	e. Exception Handling: Specific exception classes to handle errors during user operations.
	f. Concurrency: Implement concurrency checks to handle simultaneous updates to user data.
	g. Unit Testing: Writing unit tests for user services to ensure they work as expected.
	
2. Ride Management:
	a. Struct: Represent geographic coordinates using a structure that contains Latitude and Longitude.
	b. LINQ: Write LINQ queries to find available rides, nearby drivers, etc.
	c. Events: Implement custom events to notify the system of ride status changes (e.g., ride started, ride completed).
	d. Async Programming: Make ride operations (booking, tracking, etc.) asynchronous.
	e. Exception Handling: Handle exceptions related to ride management.
	f. SignalR: Real-time tracking of ride status, locations of drivers and riders.
	
3. Payment Processing:
	a. Delegates: Define delegates to process different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.).
	b. Async Programming: Make payment processing asynchronous for better responsiveness.
	c. Exception Handling: Handle exceptions specifically related to payment processing (e.g., failed payment).
	
4. Notification System:
	a. Events: Implement events integrated with SignalR to send notifications to drivers and riders (e.g., new ride request, payment confirmation).
	
5. Testing:
	a. Unit Testing: Comprehensive tests for all core logic components, services, and repositories.
	
6. Memory Management:
	a. Proper Disposal: Use IDisposable or using statements to properly dispose of unmanaged resources.
	
7. Common Infrastructure:
	a. Generics: Reusable generic repositories and services for common operations.
	
8. SignalR Integration:
	a. Location Tracking: Real-time tracking of driver and rider locations.
	b. Ride Status Notifications: Instant updates on ride status.
	c. Admin Dashboard: If required, real-time insights and updates for admins.
	d. Chat Functionality: Implement a chat functionality for driver-rider communication within the app.
